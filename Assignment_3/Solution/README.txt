How to Run
1. Please import the project into the visual studio and execute the driver class.

Information :
1.  The project mimics a 2x2 matrix and performs highly efficient operator overloading
2 .The operator overloaded methods are used in other operators to maximize the efficiency and reduce the textual coding
3 .The driver program used is provided by the professor 
4. Only a free function is implented in the driver class (printEigenValues(vector<double> &, int))
5. And the name of the class Matrix2x2 is changed to Matrix class
6. The program produces the same ouput as given in the problem statement


Lessons learned
1. More strong handling on operator overloading
2. Learnt how to reuse overloaded operators
3. Better grip on variation of member functions and friend function
